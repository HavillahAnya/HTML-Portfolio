<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Havillah Anya. I'm a website developer. I hail from Eastern Nigeria and i was born on the 9th of December 2005.
   Since 2022 i found my passion for website design and development. I started out learning webflow and figma,
   then i fell inlove with coding, and ever since my journey has been an amazing one!
</p>

<p>I've grown alot in the past years and i owe many thanks to some organisations that have played very important
   roles in helping me make my dreams come true, through their provision of free online tutorials. I'm a virtual student of Angela Yu and i feel very lucky to have
   a wonder woman as an instructor! She's an inspiration to me, and this website of mine won't have been posible
   without her guide. I hope you'll find my projects inspiring for all that you need in getting your own website started.
